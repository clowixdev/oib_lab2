During the work we doveloped a program that will help user in decrypting messages

#### Functions

This programm has 5 released functions:
        
1. Frequency analysis
    
        Program can change everything as recommended, relying on the letters constant frequency,
        or it can show you frequency dictionary that is created relying on the current cryptogram

2. Group words by letters amount

        Program will show you all the words in current cryptogram grouped by the letters amount

3. Group words by uppercase letters left

        Program is separating all the changed letters from unchanged by their register. This 
        function will group all word of current cryptogram by the amount of left uppercase letters 

4. Change letters in encrypted string

        Program will change all the uppercase letters in the current cryptogram by the ones you type

5. Revert action by id (show history)

        You can see all the action, that you did by calling this function, and revert them if you need
        
You can exit the program by entering "e"
